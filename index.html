            This website is nothing more than an homage to some of my favorite games that I play (way more than I should). I have chose the characters 
            I play the most in these games and listed the reasons I am absolutely terrible at playing them. Seriously. I get slaughtered. It's the gamer equivalent of 
            Dachau.
